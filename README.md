# Team Seg Fault: Calculating Beach Pollution Levels using Drone Images and AI

## Project Description
Our project aims to calculate the density levels of beach pollution using drone imagery and artificial intelligence. By identifying polluted beaches, we can help organizations and governments allocate their resources more effectively and work towards maintaining cleaner beaches. Additionally, our solution can help scientists identify trends and develop better strategies for mitigating pollution.

## Impact on Climate Change
Beach pollution poses a significant threat to marine life and ecosystems. Approximately 8 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the oceans every year. This pollution has severe consequences for marine life, with an estimated 100,000 marine mammals and turtles, and 1 million seabirds dying from plastic ingestion or entanglement annually.

By providing a tool that calculates pollution density levels, we can directly contribute to the efforts in combating climate change and preserving marine ecosystems. Cleaner beaches also help reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from decaying organic matter.

## Technical Approach
Our solution involves using an autonomous drone to fly over beaches and capture images of the area. These images are then processed using computer vision algorithms and artificial intelligence to determine the density of pollution. Drones provide several advantages over other solutions:

1. Autonomy: Drones can be programmed to follow a predefined path, enabling efficient data collection without constant human supervision.
2. Flexibility: The altitude at which drones operate can be easily adjusted, allowing for the capture of images at varying resolutions.
3. Environmentally friendly: Drones are electric, reducing the carbon footprint of our solution.

Please see the included simulation to better visualize the method of capturing image data from drones.
