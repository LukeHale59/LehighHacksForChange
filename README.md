# Team Seg Fault: Calculating Beach Pollution Levels using Drone Images and AI

Our project aims to calculate the density levels of beach pollution. This is important as it allows different organizations to identify which beaches to allocate their resources to. It is also important because it can help identify trends of which beaches obtain the most pollution and help scientists identify the best actions to take to keep our beaches clean.

Our solution was to have an autonomous drone fly over the beaches and take picture that we can use computer vision on to make a value for the density of pollution. 

## Impact on Climate Change

The impact of our project is significant in the fight against climate change. Here are some numerical data to illustrate the importance of cleaning beaches:

1. **Beach pollution harms marine life:** Every year, millions of marine animals are killed by plastic waste that ends up in the ocean. This includes animals like sea turtles, dolphins, and whales. By reducing beach pollution, we can help protect these animals and preserve the biodiversity of our oceans.

2. **Beach pollution affects human health:** Beach pollution can cause skin irritation, respiratory problems, and other health issues for humans. In fact, a study by the University of Miami found that people who swim in polluted water are more likely to get sick than those who swim in clean water.

3. **Beach pollution has economic consequences:** Beaches are major tourist attractions and a source of revenue for many coastal communities. However, if beaches are polluted, tourists may choose to go elsewhere, resulting in a loss of income for these communities. In fact, a study by the Natural Resources Defense Council found that beach closures due to pollution cost the US economy $3.3 billion annually in lost tourism revenue.

Our technical approach of using drones and computer vision to calculate beach pollution density is a creative and innovative solution to this problem. By automating the process of monitoring beach pollution, we can gather more accurate and frequent data, which can help organizations make better decisions about how to allocate their resources. This is a useful application of technology that can have a real impact on the health of our oceans and the communities that depend on them.
