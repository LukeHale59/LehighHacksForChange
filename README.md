# Team Seg Fault: Calculating Beach Pollution Levels using Drone Images and AI.

## Project Description
Our project aims to calculate the density levels of beach pollution. This is important as it allows different organizations to identify which beaches to allocate their resources to. It is also important because it can help identify trends of which beaches obtain the most pollution and help scientists identify the best actions to take to keep our beaches clean.

## Impact on Climate Change
Beach pollution is a major problem that affects not only marine life, but also human health and the economy. According to a report by the Ocean Conservancy, over 8 million tons of plastic waste ends up in our oceans each year. This not only harms marine life, but also releases harmful greenhouse gases as it breaks down. By identifying and cleaning up polluted beaches, we can reduce the amount of plastic waste in our oceans and mitigate the impact of climate change. 

Additionally, our use of an autonomous drone to collect data is environmentally friendly as it is electric and does not emit harmful gases into the atmosphere.

## Technical Amplitude
Our solution uses computer vision on drone images to calculate the density of beach pollution. We trained a deep learning model using a dataset of images labeled with pollution density values. The model can then predict the density levels of pollution in new images taken by the drone.

## Creativity
Our use of an autonomous drone to collect data and our implementation of computer vision on those images sets us apart from traditional methods of manually collecting data on beach pollution levels. Our solution allows for more efficient and accurate data collection, which can lead to better decision-making for organizations working to combat beach pollution.
